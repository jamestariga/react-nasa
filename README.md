# NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

**A web app that displays Nasa's astronomy picture of the day**

## Intro

This is a personal project and my very first application built using React.

## Running the project locally

You're going to need a NASA api key which you can get for free at <https://api.nasa.gov/>

1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:jamestariga/react-nasa.git`
2. `cd react-nasa` and rn `npm install`
3. Change the value of the variable `const API = "YOUR_API_KEY"` from App.js to your own API KEY
4. Run `npm start` to start the app on `http://localhost:3000`
